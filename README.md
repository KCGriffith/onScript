# onScript: about...
This repository stores bash scripts that
I felt were helpful especially when dealing
in robotics and other opensource software.
It is especially handy in recording longer bash commands.
The goal of this repository is to take complex commands,
and put them in scripts preventing the need for google searches.

# Notes on using script
* Scripts are kind of lame at the moment.
    - They have to be coppied into home directory
    - most likely you'll have to edit some based on its documentaition
    - And all bash scripts must be called as follows: `bash script` where `script` is a stand in for the script you wish to call.

* installing a script into your system is as easy as: `cp {cloned_repository_name}/{script_name} ~`


# Pull policy
* Also if I bother to look in the bash file and see no comments/documentaitions I'm rejecting the request.

# convert2Mp4
* This script requires you have ffmpeg installed.
* It takes the path to a video file and returns an .mp4 version.
